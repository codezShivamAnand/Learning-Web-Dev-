1. POSITION 
 five different position values:
    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky
 Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, 
 and right properties. For these property to work, first position value should be set 


position: static;
    Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, 
        and right properties.

position: relative;
    >positioned relative to its normal position.
    >Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned 
        element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position
    >Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

position: fixed;
    >positioned relative to the viewport
    >always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled
    >The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    >iska original place koi aur occupy kar skta hai
    >A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

position: absolute;
    >leaves its originalposition , any element can occupy 
    >positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
    >nearest positioned ancestor ka position should not be static.
    >However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and adjusts relative to the viewport,like fixed .
